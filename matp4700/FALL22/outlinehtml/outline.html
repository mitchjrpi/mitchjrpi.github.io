programming formulations, the simplex algorithm, degeneracy, geometry of convex polyhedra, duality
theory, and sensitivity analysis. Special linear programming models for assignment, transportation, and
network problems. Integer programming formulations along with branch and bound solution. Dynamic
programming.
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline"><span

follow the first seven chapters and section 21.1 of the text by Kupferschmid available on LMS.

class="cmbx-10">Piazza:</span></span>  We&#8217;ll be conducting all class-related discussion on Piazza this term. The quicker you begin asking
questions on Piazza (rather than via emails), the quicker you&#8217;ll benefit from the collective knowledge of your
classmates and instructors. We encourage you to ask questions when you&#8217;re struggling to understand a concept.
You can even do so anonymously. Link:

<!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Homework:</span></span>  Approximately every week. Homework and exam solutions will be made available online after the due
date. You may discuss the homeworks with other students. Homeworks will not be collected or graded. Solving the
homework problems (and other problems from the text) will improve your understanding of the material. Working
out the problems yourself will greatly improve your understanding of the material and help you on the
exams.
<!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Exams:</span></span>  Three in-class exams during the semester. There will be no final exam. Each exam will include at least one
question from the homeworks. You may bring one page of <span 
class="cmbx-10">handwritten </span>notes to each exam. The first exam will
cover models and the simplex algorithm. The second exam will cover duality, sensitivity analysis, and network
flow models. The third exam will cover integer programming, interior point methods, and dynamic
programming. As you would expect, the exams must be all your own work. Exam dates: Oct 4, Nov 8, Dec
9.
<!--l. 147--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Project:</span></span>  I will assign a project. This will involve modeling a problem and then analyzing the model. You may work
in groups of up to three people for the project. You should use a computer package for the project &#8212;
preferably <a 
href="https://ampl.com/" >AMPL</a>. I will describe AMPL in more detail in a class. Another option for a modeling
language is <a 
href="http://www.pyomo.org/" >Pyomo</a>. You will submit your work on the project on LMS. There will be 3 stages: initial
formulation of a working optimization model, sensitivity analysis of the model, and refinements to the
model.
<!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Grades:</span></span>  60% for the exams, 40% for the project. The 60% for the exams is broken down as 10% for your worst
exam and 25% for each of your best two exams. For the purposes of <span 
class="cmbx-10">Mid-Term Assessment</span>, exam scores will be
posted online, with identifying data removed. Grades will also be posted on <span 
class="cmbx-10">LMS</span>.

undermine the educational process. The <span
