programming formulations, the simplex algorithm, degeneracy, geometry of convex polyhedra, duality
theory, and sensitivity analysis. Special linear programming models for assignment, transportation, and
network problems. Integer programming formulations along with branch and bound solution. Dynamic
programming.

LMS.

fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I
encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
team@piazza.com.

<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Homework:</span></span>  Approximately every week. Submitted though LMS. Homework and exam solutions will be made
available online after the due date. You may discuss the homeworks with other students. Solving the homework
problems (and other problems from the text) will improve your understanding of the material. It may be possible to
find the solutions online or elsewhere: please do not use these solutions. Working out the problems yourself will
greatly improve your understanding of the material and help you on the exams. You will lose points on the
homeworks if you copy the solutions.
<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Exams:</span></span>  Three exams during the semester. There will be no final exam. The exams should take about as long as a
usual in-class 110-minute exam; to allow for possible issues with online submission, you will be given somewhat
longer. You will be able to choose between two possible times to take the exam, to accommodate remote students.
The first exam will cover models and the simplex algorithm. The second exam will cover duality, sensitivity analysis,
and network flow models. The third exam will cover integer programming, interior point methods, and dynamic
programming. As you would expect, the exams must be all your own work. Exam dates: Oct 6, Nov 10, Dec
11.
<!--l. 142--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Project:</span></span>  I will assign a project. This will involve modeling a problem and then analyzing the model. You may work
in groups of up to three people for the project. You should use a computer package for the project &#8212; preferably
<a 
href="https://ampl.com/" >AMPL</a>. I will describe AMPL in more detail in a class. Another option for a modeling language is

<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Grades:</span></span>  60% for the exams, 30% for the project, 10% for the homeworks. <br 
class="newline" />The 60% for the exams is broken down as 10% for your worst exam and 25% for each of your best two exams. For
the purposes of <span 
class="cmbx-10">Mid-Term Assessment</span>, exam scores will be posted online, with identifying data removed. Grades
will also be posted on <span
