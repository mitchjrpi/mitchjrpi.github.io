<H4>Abstract:</H4>

This thesis considers quadratic programming problems where
combinatorial constraints are directly imposed on the continuous
decision variables using a set of pairwise orthogonality relationships;
we denote this problem (QPO).
These orthogonality constraints are non-convex in nature, meaning that the
resulting combinatorial optimization problem is NP-hard.
The addition of  orthogonality constraints on
continuous variables is shown to encompass a wide range of modeling choices.

<P>

Traditional approaches for accommodating such combinatorial constraints
have been to introduce binary variables and solve the resulting
mixed-integer programming problem. Here we instead construct
a semidefinite programming problem relaxation for (QPO);
we denote this relaxation (rSDP).
For (rSDP), a symmetric lifting procedure for homogenized linear
equalities has been developed.
With a general set of orthogonality relationships, the optimal objective
function value of (rSDP) serves as a lower bound on (QPO).
Also, placing (rSDP) into an enumerative algorithm is shown to be a
useful strategy for limiting the search space.

<p>

Finally a financial application of (QPO), the portfolio rebalancing problem
in the presence of transaction costs,
is fully explored and computational results are presented.
In this application, pairwise orthogonality constraints are imposed
between buying and selling decisions. Information about the optimal
portfolio is deduced from the (rSDP) solution matrix and the geometry
of the feasible region.
