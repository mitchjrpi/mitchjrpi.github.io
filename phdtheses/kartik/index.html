<H4>Abstract:</H4>

Semidefinite Programming (SDP) has been one of the most exciting
and active areas in optimization lately. This tremendous activity was spurred by
 the discovery of
efficient interior point algorithms for solving SDP problems, and important appl
ications of the
SDP in developing approximation algorithms for various combinatorial optimizatio
n problems.
However these applications require effective techniques, to solve SDP's arising
as relaxations of these problems.
Although interior point methods are a great theoretical tool, and offer polynomi
al time complexity,
they are fairly limited in the size of problems they can handle. The thesis inve
stigates
linear programming approaches to solving SDP's. This potentially allows one to s
olve large problems
approximately and quickly, using state of the art linear solvers. The LP approac
h is also incorporated
in a branch and cut approach to solving integer programming problems.

<P>

One of the various characterizations of the positive semidefiniteness constraint
 leads to a semi-infinite
LP formulation for the SDP. We formulate the dual SDP as a semi-infinite LP, and
 discuss the issue of its
discretization in detail. Using the notions of nondegeneracy and basic feasible
solutions developed in the
context of semi-infinite linear programming, we recover a theorem due to Pataki
on the rank of extreme
matrices in SDP, which in turn implies that not more than $O(\sqrt{k})$ ($k$ is
the number of constraints
in the SDP) constraints are
required in the LP relaxations. To generate these constraints we use the spectra
l bundle approach due to
Helmberg and Rendl. This scheme recasts any SDP with a bounded feasible set as a
n eigenvalue optimization
problem. These are convex but nonsmooth problems that can be tacked by bundle me
thods for nondifferentiable
optimization. The LP approach provides an upper bound, and can also
be utilized to generate a primal feasible matrix $X$ for the spectral bundle app
roach. We demonstrate
the efficiency of the approach on two combinatorial optimization problems namely
 maxcut and minbisection.

<P>

The semi-infinite LP formulation of the SDP, together with its polynomial time s
eparation oracle
leads naturally to a cutting plane LP approach for the SDP. We investigate such
an approach.
However to make the resulting method competitive with interior point methods for
 the SDP, several refinements
are necessary. In particular the cutting
plane method requires solving the LP relaxations approximately using an interior
 point method, since
this results in better cutting planes. We experiment with various separation ora
cles generating
deep cuts, and techniques to restart the LP relaxations with strictly feasible s
tarting points.
We also relate these cutting planes to the geometry of the SDP cone. We then tes
t the approach on
the maxcut SDP.

<P>

Finally we incorporate the cutting plane LP approach to the SDP in an SDP approa
ch for
the maxcut problem. In particular, we formulate the dual of the well known SDP r
elaxation for
maxcut as a semi-infinite LP, and solve it using an interior point cutting plane
 scheme. We then
add cutting planes, which are facets of the maxcut polytope, to the primal probl
em in order to
tighten the SDP relaxations. The approach resembles a SDP cutting plane scheme f
or the maxcut
problem; in reality it uses an LP subroutine to solving the SDP within an overal
l
LP cutting plane approach for integer programming. This overcomes another shortc
oming of an SDP cutting plane
scheme, where there is no convincing warm start strategy, that allows one to qui
ckly reoptimize a slightly
perturbed version of the original SDP, after the addition of cutting planes.
We present computational results on a variety of maxcut problems.
