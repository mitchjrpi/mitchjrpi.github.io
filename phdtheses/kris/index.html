<H4>Abstract:</H4>

<p>
In the field of Operations Research (OR) we solve problems dealing with
optimization. One of the most studied problems in OR is linear programming
problems. 
These are problems that are maximization or minimization of a linear objective
function subject to linear constraints.
If we have the added burden of having restrictions on some of the variables
that must also be integral then we have a Mixed 
Integer Programming Problem.
If all of the variables must be integral then this is a 
Pure Integer Programming Problem. These are the types of problems that we are 
going to be studying more in depth.
One method used to solve Integer Programming 
Problems are known as cutting planes. There are many different types of cutting 
planes. One type of cutting plane is known as Gomory cutting planes. Gomory 
cutting planes have been studied in depth and utilized in various commercial
codes. 
We will show that by using exact arithmetic rather than floating point
arithmetic, we can produce better cuts.
The main reason for this is the addition of slack variables to the Gomory
inequalities. For exact arithmetic, this slack variable has to 
itself be integral whereas for floating point arithmetic,
the slack could be a floating point number.

What we have done is write an exact arithmetic simplex program which
incorporates some of the recent advances like LU factorization of the
basis matrix and steepest edge pivoting rule.
We have explored the size of the certain key vectors in 
the simplex algorithm.
We also wrote code that finds the all of the various forms of 
Gomory cutting planes in exact arithmetic and adds them to the simplex tableau 
and reoptimizes using dual simplex. We also wrote code that drops certain
Gomory cuts when they are not useful anymore.
We explored the size of the Gomory cutting 
planes and how it relates to the size of vectors in the simplex algorithm.
Since the majority of the time is spent reoptimizing,
we wanted to find a way to utilize the 
power of CPLEX solver and our exact Gomory cutting planes. 
</p>

<p>
Another use for exact arithmetic is when we have dual degeneracy or in other 
words, alternate optima for two dimensional problems. We pivoted to these
alternate optima and cut off this additional solution which reduced
the number of total 
Gomory iterations by performing just one extra simplex pivot.
