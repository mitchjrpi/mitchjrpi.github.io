<H2>Advice for PhD students </H2>

<p>
Some advice from various people for PhD students:

<ul>
<li>From <a href=http://marcua.net/writing/gradschool-guide/>Adam Marcus</a>,
an RPI alum in CS and math.
<li>From <a href=http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/publications/HowtoBeaSuccessfulPhDStudent.pdf>Mark Dredze and Hanna Wallach</a> (pdf).
(Here, NLP=natural language processing.)
<li>A <a href=https://webpages.uncc.edu/sakella/advice.html>collection
of links</a> from
<a href=https://webpages.uncc.edu/sakella/advice.html>Srinivas Akella</a>.
</ul>

Most of this advice is from people working in computer science,
but a lot of it is broad enough to apply to research in mathematics
or other fields.
