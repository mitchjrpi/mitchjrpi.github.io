<B><U>Course Outline:</U></B> 
Optimization is concerned with optimal allocation of resources,
and linear programming is the fundamental optimization problem.
There has been a great deal of progress in linear programming
and huge problems can now be solved routinely
using two different types of approaches -- the simplex method
and interior point methods.
This course discusses these two classes of approaches,
the theory underlying them, and extensions of the approaches.

<P>

<OL>
<LI><B>Polyhedral theory:</B> (2 weeks)
    The feasible region of a linear programming problem is a polyhedron,
    ie, the intersection of a finite collection of half spaces.
    The structure of polyhedra is discussed, including the Goldman
    Resolution theorem, and the Weyl and Minkowski theorems.
</LI>
<LI><B>The simplex algorithm:</B> (1-2 weeks)
    The simplex method is the traditional method for solving linear
    programming problems.
    I will discuss the simplex method in matrix terms, and indicate
    how it can be implemented efficiently.
</LI>
<LI><B>Decomposition and column generation
    methods for large scale problems:</B> (2 weeks)
    Some large linear programs can be broken into smaller ones and the
    polyhedral structure of linear programming can be exploited to develop
    an algorithm.
    For other problems, the number of variables is very large and an
    attractive approach is to generate columns of the constraint
    matrix only as needed.
</LI>
<LI><B>The ellipsoid algorithm:</B> (1 week)
    The ellipsoid algorithm was the first polynomial algorithm for linear
    programming. It was developed originally as an algorithm for nonlinear
    programming.
</LI>
<LI><B>Interior point methods:</B> (8 weeks)
    Topics to be discussed include the similarity of these algorithms
    to traditional nonlinear programming methods, the polynomial complexity
    of many of these algorithms, the asymptotic rate of convergence of
    the algorithms, and the computational results achieved.
    Interior point methods for semidefinite programming and
    second order cone programming problems will be discussed.
    Efficient linear algebra techniques will also be discussed.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<B><U>Grading policy:</U></B> 
The grade will be determined by three elements: homework, a midterm exam,
and a project. The three elements will be equally important.
For the purposes of <B>Mid-Term Assessment</B>,
homework and exam scores will be posted online, with identifying data removed.

<P>
I will give out a <B>homework</B> approximately every two weeks.
The homeworks will probably contain some computational work using
<a href=http://www.rpi.edu/~mitchj/ampldetails.html>AMPL</a>,
a mathematical programming modeling language.
You should learn a fair amount from the homeworks.
  Therefore, try working out the solutions on your own.
  If you have difficulties,
  you may talk to me or to other students about the homeworks,
  but you must write up your solutions on your own.
  You may be able to find the solutions to some of the homework
  questions on the web: do not use these solutions!

<P>
There will be an <B>in-class midterm exam</B> on about Thursday, April&nbsp;3.
The exam must be all your own work.

<P>
The <B>project</B> will involve modeling and computational testing.
Depending on the project, the testing may use
<a href=http://www.rpi.edu/~mitchj/ampldetails.html>AMPL</a> or it may use
a programming language such as
<a href=http://www.rpi.edu/~mitchj/ampldetails.html>AMPL</a> or C or FORTRAN.
You will write up your solution and give a presentation in class.
Your project can be one of the following:

<UL>
<LI>a topic arising in your research
that fits well with the topics covered in the course.
You would work on your own on such a project.
</LI>
<LI>another project you suggest or I suggest.
You can work in groups of up to three people on such
a project.
All group members should contribute equally to the project. 
Each individual should turn in a one-page description of their 
contribution to the project along with the group report.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Possible topics include:

<UL>
<LI>Install a <a href=http://www.coin-or.org/>COIN-OR</a>
package on cmc-math, and get some computational results.
Create instructions so anyone can run the package.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Benchmark some solvers: eg
<a href=http://www.mosek.com/>MOSEK</a> vs
<a href=http://www.rpi.edu/~mitchj/ampldetails.html>CPLEX</a> for SOCP problems

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Develop a column generation or cutting plane algorithm for
an integer program or another hard optimization problem.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Investigate warm-starting methods for semidefinite programming.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Combine interior point and simplex cutting plane algorithms:
start with interior point, crossover to simplex.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Combine Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition with simplex:
Use DW to get a good solution,
create a bfs, finish off.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Compare two different approaches. Eg, compare
<a href=http://www.rpi.edu/~mitchj/ampldetails.html>CPLEX</a>
LP solver with some linear cuts to
<a href=http://www.rpi.edu/~mitchj/ampldetails.html>CPLEX</a>
socp for an SOCP.

Because there is considerable continuing research on interior point methods,
I will draw some material from current papers.
I will put links to several
papers on the course webpage as the course progresses.
The following textbooks each cover part of the course and
