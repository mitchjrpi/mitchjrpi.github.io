<B>Details for Wednesday May 7</B>

<P>
Each of the thirteen groups needs to hand in a <B>typewritten report</B>.
It should describe the problem you worked on, what you did to solve the problem, and the significance of what you did. You should also cite relevant references and state what was novel about your approach. For group projects, also hand in one sheet from each group member discussing his or her individual contribution.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
The session will take place in <B>Low 3051 from 10.30am-2.30pm</B>.
Note that we will start an hour earlier than the time listed in the exam schedule.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
Each presentation should be about <B>15 minutes</B> long.

<P>

<P>
In order to encourage <B>questions</B>, your grade will not be lowered if
you are unable to answer questions from other students, but it may be
raised. Moreover, I may give some <B>bonus points</B> for asking a particularly
good question.

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
We will take about a five minute break after each set of three presentations,
with a longer break if desired after six talks.
You can bring lunch with you to the session.
