Take Home   \hfill    Due:  Thursday, March 28, 2002, in class.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

This is to be all your own work.  You may use any result from class,
homeworks, the textbook, or the books on reserve in the library.
Do not consult anybody or anything else. 
My email address is {\em mitchj@rpi.edu} and
my phone number is 276--6915.
I'll have my regular office hours on Wednesday from 10am to 12 noon.

In order that I can display grades, please write a 4 digit number
on the front of your solution set.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (30 points)
\begin{enumerate}
\item (10 points)
Consider the linear programming problem
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{lrclr}
\min & c^Tx \\
\mbox{subject to } & Ax & = & b & (Pb) \\
& 0 \; \leq \;  x & \leq & u
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
where $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix,
$b$ is an $m$-vector,
and $c$, $u$, and $x$ are $n$-vectors.
Notice that each variable $x_i$ has a finite bound $u_i$.
Show that the dual linear program to $(Pb)$ is feasible.
\item (20 points)
Consider the standard form primal-dual pair
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{lrclrlrcrclr}
\min & c^Tx &&&& \max & b^Ty \\
\mbox{subject to } & Ax & = & b & (P) \qquad & \mbox{subject to } & A^Ty & + & s & = & c & (D) \\
& x & \geq & 0 &&&&& s & \geq & 0
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
where $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix,
$b$ and $y$ are $m$-vectors,
and $c$, $s$, and $x$ are $n$-vectors.
Assume $(P)$ and $(D)$ are both feasible.
Let $Q_P$ and $Q_D$ be the feasible regions for $(P)$ and $(D)$ respectively.
Show that if $x_i$ is bounded in $Q_P$ then $s_i$ is unbounded in $Q_D$.
\end{enumerate}
  \item  (20 points)
    Let $B$ be an $m \times m$ nonsingular matrix, and suppose $B=LQ$,
    where $L$ is a lower-triangular $m \times m$ matrix and $Q$ is an
    orthogonal $m \times m$ matrix (that is, $QQ^T=I$).
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item (5 points) Show that $BB^T=LL^T$.
      \item (5 points)
        How would you solve the linear systems $B^Ty=c$ and $Bd=a$ given
        $L$ and~$Q$. (The $m$-vectors $c$ and $a$ are known; the $m$-vectors
        $y$ and $d$ have to be found.)
      \item (5 points)
        Suppose the matrix $Q$ is not stored and you are given only~$L$.
        How can you solve $B^Ty=c$ and $Bd=a$?
      \item (5 points)
        Suppose we now want to update the matrix $B$ to the matrix $\bar{B}$
        by replacing column $p$ of $B$ by the vector~$a$.
        Denote column~$p$ of $B$ by~$b$ and let $e_p$ denote the $p$th unit
        vector.
        Then we can write
        \begin{displaymath}
          \bar{B}=B+(a-b)e_p^T.
        \end{displaymath}
        Show that
        \begin{displaymath}
          \bar{L}\bar{L}^T = LL^T - bb^T +aa^T,
        \end{displaymath}
        where $\bar{L}$ satisfies $\bar{B}=\bar{L}\bar{Q}$ for some orthogonal
        matrix~$\bar{Q}$.
        (Note: You may assume that every $m \times m$ matrix $M$ has a
       ${\mathit QR}$-{\em factorization},
       where $Q$ is orthogonal and $R$ is uppertriangular, and $M=QR$.
      For this part, you do not need to derive $\bar{L}$ or $\bar{Q}$ explicitly.)
   \item (Extra credit: 5 points)
      How would you update $L$ to find the lower triangular matrix~$\bar{L}$?
    \end{enumerate}
\item (20 points)
Let $z^*$ be the finite optimal value of the feasible linear programming problem
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{lrclr}
\min & c^Tx \\
\mbox{subject to } & Ax & = & b & (P) \\
& x & \geq & 0
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
where $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix,
$b$ is an $m$-vector,
and $c$ and $x$ are $n$-vectors.
Let $R_{\epsilon}$ be the optimal value of the linear programming problem
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{lrclr}
\max & e^Tx \\
\mbox{subject to } & Ax & = & b & (P_{\epsilon}) \\
& c^Tx & \leq & z^* + \epsilon \\
& x & \geq & 0
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
where $\epsilon$ is a positive scalar and $e$ is the $n$-vector of all ones.
The quantity $R_{\epsilon}$ can be interpreted as the 1-norm of
the largest vector in the $\epsilon$ level set
$Q_{\epsilon}:=\{x \geq 0: Ax=b, c^Tx \leq z^* + \epsilon \}$.
Let $\epsilon' > \epsilon$. Show that
\begin{displaymath}
R_{\epsilon'} \leq \frac{\epsilon'}{\epsilon} R_{\epsilon}.
\end{displaymath}
  \item  (10 points)
Construct a four-vertex transshipment network with the following counterintuitive property:
If the supply is decreased by one unit at an appropriately chosen vertex and demand is decreased by one unit at
another appropriately  chosen vertex then the optimal transshipment cost increases.
(Both the original network flow problem and the modified problem should
be feasible.)
\item (20 points)
Use the network simplex algorithm to find the minimum cost flow for the problem with 
the following linear programming representation:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{lrcrcrcrcrcrcl}
\min & & - & 2x_{13}& - & x_{23} & - & 2x_{24} &&& - & 10 x_{41} \\
\mbox{subject to} & -x_{12} & - & x_{13} &&&&&&& + & x_{41} & = & 0 \\
& x_{12} &&& - & x_{23} & - & x_{24} &&&&& = & 0 \\
&&& x_{13} & + & x_{23} &&& - & x_{34} &&& = & 0 \\
&&&&&&& x_{24} & + & x_{34} & - & x_{41} & = & 0 \\
& \multicolumn{11}{r}{0 \, \leq \, x_{12}, x_{13}, x_{23}, x_{24}, x_{34}} & \leq & 1 \\
&&&&&&&&& 0 & \leq & x_{41} & \leq & 10
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
Use the initial basic feasible solution with basic variables:
\begin{displaymath}
x_{12} = 1, \quad x_{34}=1, \quad x_{41}=1
\end{displaymath}
and nonbasic variables
\begin{displaymath}
x_{13}=0, \quad x_{23}=1, \quad x_{24}=0.
\end{displaymath}
You should need three iterations.
\end{enumerate}
