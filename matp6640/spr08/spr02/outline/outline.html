<B><U>Course Outline:</U></B> 
The first half of the course will examine polyhedral theory, the simplex method,
decomposition and column generation methods for large scale linear
programming problems, and the ellipsoid method.
The second half will cover interior point methods for linear programming.
Interior point methods can be regarded as methods for nonlinear programming
applied to linear programming. They can also be used to solve nonlinear
programming problems.

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD><B>Polyhedral theory:</B> (2 weeks)
The feasible region of a linear programming problem is a polyhedron,
    ie, the intersection of a finite collection of half spaces.
    The structure of polyhedra is discussed, including the Goldman
    Resolution theorem, and the Weyl and Minkowski theorems.
  <DT>2.
<DD><B>The simplex algorithm:</B> (1-2 weeks)
    The simplex method is the traditional method for solving linear
    programming problems.
    I will discuss the simplex method in matrix terms, and indicate
    how it can be implemented efficiently.
  <DT>3.
<DD><B>Decomposition and column generation
    methods for large scale problems:</B> (2 weeks)
    Some large linear programs can be broken into smaller ones and the
    polyhedral structure of linear programming can be exploited to develop
    an algorithm.
    For other problems, the number of variables is very large and an
    attractive approach is to generate columns of the constraint
    matrix only as needed.
  <DT>4.
<DD><B>The ellipsoid algorithm:</B> (1 week)
    The ellipsoid algorithm was the first polynomial algorithm for linear
    programming. It was developed originally as an algorithm for nonlinear
    programming.
  <DT>5.
<DD><B>Interior point methods:</B> (8 weeks)
    Topics to be discussed include the similarity of these algorithms
    to traditional nonlinear programming methods, the polynomial complexity
    of many of these algorithms, the asymptotic rate of convergence of
    the algorithms, and the computational results achieved.
    Interior point methods for quadratic programming problems and general
    convex problems will also be discussed.
    Efficient linear algebra techniques will also be discussed.
</DL>

<P>


<B><U>Grading policy:</U></B> 
The grade will be determined by three elements: homework, a midterm exam,
and a presentation. The three elements will be equally important.
I will give out a homework approximately every two weeks.
The homeworks will probably contain some computational work.
There will be a take home midterm exam.
The presentation will be of one or two recent papers in interior
point methods. You will also have to write a summary/analysis of the paper(s).

<P>
You should learn a fair amount from the homeworks.
  Therefore, try working out the solutions on your own.
  If you have difficulties,
  you may talk to me or to other students about the homeworks,
  but you must write up your solutions on your own.
The exam must be all your own work.
The presentations will be individual.
You may discuss your paper(s) with other people and with me,
but your summary must be your own work, and you will obviously
have to do your own presentation.

Because there is a great deal of continuing research on interior point methods,
I will draw some material from current papers.
I will put several
papers on reserve as the semester progresses.
The following textbooks each cover part of the course and
are on reserve in the library.

<B><U>Prerequisites:</U></B>  
MATP4700/DSES4770, or permission of instructor.
Familiarity with linear programming and linear algebra will be assumed.
Some elements of MATP6600/DSES6780 and MATP4820/DSES4780,
such as the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
optimality conditions and Newton's
method, will be used, although it is not necessary to have seen this material
before.

<B><U>Academic Integrity:</U></B>  
Student-teacher relationships are based on mutual trust.
Acts which violate this trust undermine the educational process.
The <EM>Rensselaer Handbook</EM> defines various forms of academic
dishonesty and procedures for responding to them.
The penalties for cheating can include failure in the course,
as well as harsher punishments. 
<BR>

<P>


<B><U>Appealing grades:</U></B> 
As with any other administrative question regarding this course,
see me in the first instance.  If we are unable to reach agreement,
you may appeal my decision to the Chair of the Math Sciences department.
