<HR>

Each presentation should take about 20 to 25 minutes.
You should describe the major contribution(s) of the paper(s) you present.
You should write up a short (3 to 5 pages) typewritten analysis of the paper(s),
which I will photocopy and give out <I>before your presentation</I>.

<P>

In order to encourage questions, your grade will not be lowered if you are
unable to answer questions from other students, but it may be raised.
Moreover, I may give some bonus points for asking a particularly good question.
