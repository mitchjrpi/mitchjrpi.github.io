<h3>Abstract:</h3>

We consider the problem faced by managers of critical civil interdependent
infrastructure systems of restoring essential public services after a
non-routine event causes disruptions to these services.
In order to restore the services, we must determine the set of components
(or tasks) that will be temporarily installed or repaired, assign these tasks
to work groups, and then determine the schedule of each work group to complete
the tasks assigned to it.  These restoration planning and scheduling decisions
are often undertaken in an independent, sequential manner.  We provide a
mathematical model that integrates the restoration and planning decisions that
specifically accounts for the interdependencies between the infrastructure
systems.  The objective function of this problem provides a measure of how
well the services are being restored over the horizon of the restoration plan,
rather than just focusing on the performance of the systems after all
restoration efforts are complete.  We test our model on realistic data
representing infrastructure systems in New York City.  Our computational
results demonstrate that we can provide integrated restoration and scheduling
plans of high quality with limited computational resources.  We also discuss
the benefits of integrating the restoration and scheduling decisions.
