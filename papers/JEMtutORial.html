<h3>Abstract:</h3>

Interior point methods have proven very successful at solving
linear programming problems.
When an explicit linear programming formulation is either not available
or is too large to employ directly,
a column generation approach can be used.
Examples of column generation approaches include
cutting plane methods for integer programming
and decomposition methods for many classes of optimization problems.
We discuss the use of interior point methods in a column generation scheme.

<p>

Semidefinite programming relaxations of combinatorial optimization
problems are often tighter than linear programming relaxations.
We describe some research in using SDP relaxations to find exact solutions
to combinatorial optimization problems.
Semidefinite programs are expensive to solve directly, so we also consider
cutting surface approaches to solving them.

<p>

Finally, we look at recent smoothing techniques for solving nonsmooth
optimization problems using a subgradient approach;
these methods have some links to cutting surface approaches.
