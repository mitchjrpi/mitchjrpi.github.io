<H3>Abstract:</H3>
Until recently, the study of interior point methods has dominated algorithmic
research in semidefinite programming (SDP). From a theoretical point of view,
these interior point methods offer everything one can hope for; they apply to
all SDP's, exploit second order information and offer polynomial time
complexity. Still for practical applications with many constraints $k$,
the number of arithmetic operations, per iteration is often too high.
This motivates the search for other approaches, that are suitable for
large $k$ and exploit problem structure.

Recently Helmberg and Rendl developed a scheme that casts SDP's with a constant
trace on the primal feasible set as eigenvalue optimization problems. These
are convex nonsmooth programming problems and can be solved by bundle methods.
In this paper we propose a linear programming framework to solving SDP's
with this structure. Although SDP's are semi infinite linear programs,
we show that only a small number of constraints, namely those in the bundle
maintained by the spectral bundle approach, bounded by the square root of
the number of constraints in the SDP, and others polynomial in the problem
size are typically required. The resulting LP's can be solved rather quickly
and provide reasonably accurate solutions. We present numerical examples
demonstrating the efficiency of the approach on combinatorial examples.
