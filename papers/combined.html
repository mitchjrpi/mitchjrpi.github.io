<H3>Abstract:</H3>
We describe a cutting plane algorithm for solving linear ordering
problems. The algorithm uses a primal-dual
interior point method to solve the
first few relaxations and then switches to a simplex method to solve
the last few relaxations. The simplex method uses CPLEX 4.0.
We compare the algorithm with one that uses only an interior point
method and with one that uses only a simplex method.
We solve integer programming problems with as many as 31125 binary variables.
Computational results show that the combined approach can dramatically
outperform the other two methods.
