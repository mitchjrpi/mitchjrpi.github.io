<h4>Abstract:</h4>

Cutting plane methods provide the means to solve large scale
semidefinite programs (SDP) cheaply and quickly. They can also
conceivably be employed for the purposes of re-optimization after
branching, or the addition of cutting planes. We give a survey of
various cutting plane approaches for SDP in this paper. These
cutting plane approaches arise from various perspectives, and
include techniques based on interior point cutting plane
approaches, non-differentiable optimization, and finally an
approach which mimics the simplex method for linear programming
(LP).

<p>

We present an accessible introduction to various cutting plane
approaches that have appeared in the literature.
We place these methods in a unifying framework which illustrates
how each approach
arises as a natural enhancement of a primordial LP cutting plane
scheme based on a semi-infinite formulation of the SDP.
