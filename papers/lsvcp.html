<B>Abstract:</B>
A cutting plane method for linear/convex programming is described. It
is based on the volumetric barrier, introduced by Vaidya. The
algorithm is a long step one, and has a complexity of O(n^{1.5}L)
Newton steps. This is better than the O(n\sqrt{m}L) complexity of
non-cutting plane long step methods based on the volumetric barrier,
but it is however worse than Vaidya's original O(nL) result (which
is not a long step algorithm). Major features of our algorithm are
that when adding cuts we add them right through the current point, and
when seeking progress in the objective, the duality gap is reduced by
a constant factor (not true for Vaidya's original algorithm). Further, we
generate primal as well as dual iterates, making this applicable in
the column generation context as well, and allowing early termination.
Vaidya's algorithm has been used as a subroutine to obtain the best
complexity for several combinatorial optimization problems -- e.g, the
Held-Karp lower bound for the Traveling Salesperson Problem. While our
complexity result is weaker, this long step cutting plane algorithm is
likely to be computationally more promising on such combinatorial
optimization problems with an exponential number of constraints. We also
discuss a multiple cuts version --- where upto p<=n  `selectively
orthonormalized' cuts are added through the current point at each
stage where cuts are identified by the oracle. This has a
complexity of O(n^{1.5}L p log p)  quasi Newton steps.
