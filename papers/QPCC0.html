<h3>Abstract:</h3>

The  paper shows that the global resolution of a general
convex quadratic program with complementarity constraints (QPCC),
possibly infeasible or unbounded,
can be accomplished
in finite time.  The method constructs a minmax mixed integer
formulation by introducing finitely many binary variables, one for
each complementarity constraint. Based on the primal-dual
relationship of a pair of convex quadratic programs and on a logical
Benders scheme, an extreme ray/point generation
procedure is developed, which relies on valid satisfiability constraints for the
integer program. To improve this scheme, we propose a
two-stage approach wherein the first stage solves the mixed integer
quadratic program with pre-set upper bounds
on the complementarity variables, and the second stage solves the
program outside this bounded region by the Benders scheme.  We
report computational results with our method. We also investigate
the addition of a penalty term yDw to the objective function,
where y and w are the complementary variables and D is a
nonnegative diagonal matrix. The matrix D can be chosen
effectively by solving a semidefinite program, ensuring
that the objective function remains convex.
The addition of the penalty term can often reduce the overall
runtime by at least 50%. We report preliminary
computational testing on a  QP relaxation method which can be used
to obtain better lower bounds from infeasible points; this method
could be incorporated into a branching scheme. By combining the
penalty method and the  QP relaxation method, more than 90% of the
gap can be closed for some QPCC problems.
