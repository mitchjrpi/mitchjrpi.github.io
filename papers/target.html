ABSTRACT:  <BR>
We introduce a procedure, called target-matching, for maximizing the extent
to which a stochastic forecasting model generates forecasts (scenarios)
that demonstrate a specified behavior. The procedure defines a non-convex
optimization problem that we solve with an adaptation of tabu search.
The approach allows managers to perform customized risk analysis by choosing
a pattern of future stochasticities for which they want a well-hedged
strategy, a capability that distinguishes the process from classical
techniques of parameter estimation. We apply the method to Towers Perrin's
economic scenario generation system.
