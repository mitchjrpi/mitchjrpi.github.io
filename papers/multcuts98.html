<B>Abstract:</B>
We study the issue of updating the analytic center after
multiple cutting planes have been added through the analytic
center of the current polytope. This is an important issue
that arises at every `stage' in a cutting plane algorithm.
If $\numadd \leq n$\ cuts are to be added, we show
that we can use a `Selective Orthonormalization' procedure to
modify the cuts before adding them --- it is then easy to
identify a direction for an affine step into the interior of
the new polytope, and
the next analytic center is then found
in $O(\sqrt{\numadd} \log \numadd)$\ Newton
steps.
Even if we wish to add the cuts without
modifying them, we can still find the next analytic center in
modifying them, we can still find the next analytic center in
$O(\sqrt{\numadd}t)$\ Newton steps, where all operations are on
$t$\ bit numbers. This is true for arbitrary $\numadd$.
If at most two cuts are added then the
new analytic center can be found in $O(1)$ Newton steps.
Further, we show that a multiple cut
variant with selective orthonormalization
of an algorithm of Atkinson and Vaidya
has the same complexity as the original algorithm.
