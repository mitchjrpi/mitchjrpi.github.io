<h3>Abstract:</h3>

This paper addresses the problem of designing supply chains that are resilient to natural or human-induced extreme events. It focuses on the development of efficient restoration strategies that aid the supply chain in recovering from a disruption, thereby limiting the impact on its customers. The proposed restoration model takes into account possible disruptions to infrastructures, e.g., transportation and communications, by explicitly formulating their logical relationships with supply chains. A problem solving process is proposed that provides for cooperation between the managers of the infrastructures and the managers of the supply chains disrupted by an extreme event. Both the model and the problem solving process are exercised with a realistic industry problem.
