<h3>Abstract:</h3>
The goal of our effort is to eliminate or reduce the impact of a disruption
to our critical 
infrastructures by protecting the quality of the services they provide.
Decision technology 
supports those responsible for achieving this by: 
<ul>
<li>
Quantifying the degradation of services provided by all the systems when one or more 
component of any system is damaged or destroyed. 
<li>
Evaluating alternative means to reduce or eliminate the impact caused by an incident. 
</ul>

The Interdependent Layered Network (ILN) mathematical model was developed with the 
support of the National Science Foundation. The ILN model has been embedded in a 
prototype decision support system, MUNICIPAL, the MUlti-Network Interdependent Critical 
Infrastructure Program for Analysis of Lifelines, to support the design and assessment of 
protection strategies including: 
<ul>
<li> identifying key elements to reduce the impact. 
<li> determining what levels of effort are required to restore service. 
<li> designing alternative paths to reduce vulnerability. 
<li> determining where to site emergency response resources to rapidly restore services 
after a disruption. 
</ul>
MUNICIPAL supports response and restoration following disruptions, facilitates analysis of 
threat scenarios and supports emergency preparation and training activities. Research has 
shown that MUNICIPAL can be used to identify vulnerability, taking interdependency into 
account, and suggest alternative strategies for protection of infrastructure systems. Data on 
the lifeline systems for the southern portion of Manhattan and the impact area of the 
Northridge earthquake are being used to assess the model. 

<p>

This paper will discuss the research needed to develop the ILN model and MUNICIPAL, the 
decision support system. It will then discuss the components of MUNICIPAL and how it can 
be used for system design, vulnerability analysis and restoration following a disruption.
