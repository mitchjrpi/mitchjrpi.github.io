<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
We consider the problem of restoring services provided by infrastructure systems after an extreme event disrupts them. This research proposes a novel integrated network design and scheduling problem that models these restoration efforts. In this problem, work groups must be allocated to build nodes and arcs into a network in order to maximize the cumulative weighted flow in the network over a horizon. We develop a novel heuristic dispatching rule that selects the next set of tasks to be processed by the work groups. We further propose families of valid inequalities for an integer programming formulation of the problem, one of which specifically links the network design and scheduling decisions. Our methods are tested on realistic data sets representing the infrastructure systems of New Hanover County, North Carolina in the United States and lower Manhattan in New York City. These results indicate that our methods can be used in both real-time restoration activities and long-term scenario planning activities. Our models are also applied to explore the effects on the restoration activities of aligning them with the goals of an emergency manager and to benchmark existing restoration procedures.
