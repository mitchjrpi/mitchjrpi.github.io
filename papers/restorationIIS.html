<h3>Abstract:</h3>


<p>
Modern society depends on the operations of civil infrastructure systems, such 
as transportation, energy, telecommunications and water. Clearly, disruption of any of these 
systems would present a significant detriment to daily living. However, these systems have 
become so interconnected, one relying on another, that disruption of one may lead to disruptions 
in all. The focus of this research is on developing techniques which can be used to respond to 
events that have the capability to impact interdependent infrastructure systems. As discussed in 
the paper, infrastructure interdependencies become critical when an impact on one infrastructure 
system affects one or more other infrastructure systems. The approach is to model the salient 
elements of these systems and provide decision makers with a means to manipulate the model.  
</p>

<p>
Definitions of five types of interdependency identified during the research are presented and 
incorporated into a network flows mathematical representation. The mathematical representation, 
i.e. an interdependent layer network model, is described, including the formulation of the 
infrastructure interdependencies. Using the lower Manhattan region of New York, USA for 
illustrative purposes, implementation of the model is shown. First the data requirements are 
presented with realistic data on the interdependent infrastructure systems of power, 
telecommunications and subways. Next, a scenario is given that causes major disruption in the 
services provided by these infrastructures. Finally, three cases of possible restoration of services
are presented depicting progressive stages of service recovery following a disruption. The paper 
concludes with a discussion of accomplishments and opportunities for future work.
