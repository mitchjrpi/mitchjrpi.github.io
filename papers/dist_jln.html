<h4>Abstract:</h4>

This paper presents an interior point approach to 
exact distance computation between convex objects represented 
as intersections of implicit surfaces. Exact distance computation 
algorithms are particularly important for applications involving 
objects that make contact, such as in multibody dynamic
simulations and in contact point prediction for dextrous manipulation. 
They can also be used in the narrow phase of hierarchical
collision detection. In contrast to geometric approaches 
developed for polyhedral objects, we formulate the distance 
computation problem as a convex optimization problem; this 
optimization formulation has been previously described for 
polyhedral objects. We demonstrate that for general convex objects
represented as implicit surfaces, interior point approaches 
are sufficiently fast, and owing to their global convergence
properties, are the only provably good choice for solving proximity 
query problems for some object classes. We use a primal-dual
interior point algorithm that solves the KKT conditions 
obtained from the convex programming formulation. For the 
case of polyhedra and quadrics, we establish a theoretical time 
complexity of O(n^1.5), where n is the number of constraints. 
We present implementation results for example implicit surface 
objects, including polyhedra, quadrics, and generalizations of 
quadrics such as superquadrics and hyperquadrics, as well 
as intersections of these surfaces. We demonstrate that in 
practice, the algorithm takes time linear in the number of 
constraints, and that distance computation rates of about 1 
kHz can be achieved. We also extend the approach to proximity 
queries between deforming convex objects. Finally, we show that 
continuous collision detection for linearly translating objects 
can be performed by solving two related convex optimization 
problems. For polyhedra and quadrics, we establish that the 
computational complexity of this problem is O(n^1.5).
