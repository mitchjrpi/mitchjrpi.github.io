<h3>Abstract:</h3>

Semidefinite  relaxations of certain combinatorial
optimization problems lead to approximation algorithms with performance
guarantees.
For large-scale problems, it may not be computationally feasible to
solve the semidefinite relaxations to optimality.
In this paper, we investigate the effect on the performance guarantees
of an approximate solution to the semidefinite relaxation
for MAXCUT, MAX2SAT, and MAX3SAT.
We show that it is possible to make simple modifications to the approximate
solutions and
obtain performance guarantees that depend linearly
on the most negative eigenvalue of the approximate solution,
the size of the problem, and the duality gap.
In every case, we recover the original performance guarantees
in the limit as the solution approaches the optimal solution to the semidefinite relaxation.
