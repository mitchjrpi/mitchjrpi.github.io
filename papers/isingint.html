ABSTRACT:  <BR>
An interior point cutting plane algorithm for solving Maximum Cut problems
  of a particular structure is described. The problem of interest is
  determining the ground states of two dimensional +J,-J Ising spin glasses
  on square lattices with nearest neighbour interactions and periodic
  boundary conditions. Computational results for grids of sizes up to
  100 x 100 are presented. An estimate of the ground state energy
  of an infinite
  spin glass system with the proportion of negative bonds equal to 0.5
  is given.
