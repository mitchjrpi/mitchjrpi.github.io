<h3>Abstract:</h3>


<p>
The impact of extreme events is in reality the interaction among three systems; the natural 
environment, the human community, and the built environment - the infrastructure that 
supports human activities. The sustainability of our infrastructure depends upon knowledge 
of the natural environment - for example, the research on global warming and its impact on 
meteorological events such as storms, droughts and floods. Sustainability also depends upon 
the demographic composition and distribution of population. Shifts in population require 
expanded infrastructures; people moving into hazardous regions like coastal areas may 
require new infrastructure. 
</p>
 

<p>
The events of September 11, 2001 show once again the vulnerability of our civil 
infrastructure systems. However, the on-going attention may provide the opportunity to 
increase the sustainability of civil infrastructures while reducing their vulnerability- the focus 
of this paper. 
</p>
 

<p>
The paper first presents background related to sustainability and vulnerability of 
infrastructure systems. A systematic procedure including an optimization algorithm is 
presented to incorporate sustainability concerns into the vulnerability analysis. An illustrative 
example is given, followed by concluding remarks on its integration with past research on 
vulnerability of civil infrastructure systems.
