three model files:

(1) sudoku.mod:  known entries in the square are input in triples.
    Eg, if square(3,2) contains a 5, then the KNOWN[5,2,3]=1.

(2) sudokuInit.mod: known entries are input in a 9x9 grid, with
    zeroes representing the unknown entries.

(3) sudokuQ.mod: as for sudoku.mod, except with a quadratic objective

(4) sudokuQI.mod: as for sudokuInit.mod, except a quadratic
    objective is used, to try to find alternative feasible
    solutions to the LP relaxation.


sudoku2.dat and sudoku3.dat are input files for sudoku.mod

sudokuI.dat is an input file for sudokuInit.mod and sudokuQ.mod

sudoku5.dat is Problem 25 from the Guardian Weekly of Feb 17-23, 2006.
The LP solution is fractional, and the preprocessor with CPLEX B&B
is unable to solve it. The problem does solve in the root node.
sudokuI5.dat is the same problem in the other format.
