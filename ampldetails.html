You can run CPLEX in standalone mode, or you can call it from
C or C++ or Matlab or Python.
<br>
If you are an RPI student, you may be able to get our 2008 version of AMPL
to work with the current version of CPLEX.

<h3>Background information and reading</h3>
     <B> <A HREF="http://www.ampl.com/">AMPL</A> </B>
       is a mathematical programming and optimization modeling language
       which can be used to solve linear, integer, and nonlinear
       programming problems.
       You can input your model into AMPL in a reasonably intuitive
       way and it will use a solver (such as MINOS or CPLEX) for solving
       the problem.
       It is capable of solving linear, nonlinear, and integer programs.
<p>
The <a href=http://www.ampl.com>AMPL</a> website
contains the
<a href=http://www.ampl.com/BOOK/index.html>whole of the AMPL book</a>,
a collection of
<a href=http://www.ampl.com/FAQ/>frequently asked questions</a>,
and a <a href=http://www.ampl.com/BOOKLETS/README101.cplex>list of
all the cplex options available in AMPL</a>.

<h3>The student version of AMPL</h3>

The <a href=http://www.ampl.com>AMPL</a> website
contains
<a href=http://www.ampl.com/DOWNLOADS/index.html>downloadable executables</a>
for use in Windows or in Unix/Linux systems, including Mac OSX.
These executables are limited in the size of problems they can solve.
<p>
Note that if you use the <b>command line interface with Windows</b>
and you use Word to create and edit the files, Word will add <tt>txt</tt> to
the end of a filename when stored as a text file.
For example, if your model is called <tt>zoff.mod</tt> and you created it and
stored it using Word, the file will be called <tt>zoff.mod.txt</tt>.
To read it into AMPL, you will need to use the command
<pre>
ampl: model zoff.mod.txt;
</pre>

<h3>Size-unrestricted versions of AMPL and CPLEX</h3>

Our current version is <b>CPLEX 11</b>, as of May 2008.

<p>
You must have an RPI account to be able to use the size-unrestricted versions.

<p><b>The access.ilm file included in the distribution no longer works</b>.
Consequently, you cannot currently run AMPL or CPLEX by
following the instruction below.</p>

<p>
<strike>
<b>Installing AMPL and CPLEX on your personal computer</b>:
Our license now allows you to
<a href=Ilog_Installation_Instruction_Using_ARCVFS.html>install the size-unrestricted versions of
these programs on your own machine</a>.
Once you've installed the programs in Windows XP,
you run them from a command prompt window.
In Linux or in Mac OS X, they run in a terminal window.
The program <b>OPL</b> is also available, as an alternative to AMPL.
OPL is an ILOG modelling language and environment that has a user
interface that is more user-friendly than AMPL.
You can even run them from off-campus as long as you have
<a href=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/nss/www/downloads/vpn.html>Cisco VPN</a>
running.
<p>
To use the size-unrestricted version of <b>AMPL on RCS</b>, you need to follow
<a href=cplex11.html>these instructions</a>.

<h3>IBM Academic Initiative</h3>
CPLEX is an IBM product, so it can be obtained through the
<!--
<a href=https://ibm.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingDetails.aspx?o=733c3d21-0ce1-e711-80fa-000d3af41938&pmv=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000>IBM Academic Initiative</a>.
-->
<a href=https://www.ibm.com/academic>IBM Academic Initiative</a>.
After registering, you will be able to download the latest version
of CPLEX.
As of version 12, CPLEX is multithreaded.

<p>

<!--
AMPL is not an IBM product and so our version of AMPL cannot be used
with versions of CPLEX downloaded through the acadmic initiative,
as far as I know.
-->
A downloaded version of CPLEX can either be run as a stand-alone program
or called from other software written in C or C++ or Matlab, for example.

<!--
<b><font color=ee0044>Note:</font></b>
Our license server was changed on <b>March 20, 2006</b>.
Therefore, you may need to update your <tt>access.ilm</tt> file.
Instructions for getting this file are in Steps 2 and 3 of the
<a href=ILOG11.htm>instructions for installing the programs on your
machine.</a>

<h3>More on solvers</h3>

<b>AMPL</b> is a modelling language. It uses other packages to
actually solve optimization problems.
The default solver we have available on campus is
<b>CPLEX</b>.
Our current version of CPLEX will solve integer, linear, and
convex quadratic programming problems.
As of June 15, 2006, it can solve quadratically
constrained problems, including quadratically constrained
integer programs.
<!--
However, it does not solve integer quadratic programs.
To solve a <b>quadratic</b> program from within AMPL using CPLEX,
you need to enter the line
<br>
<tt>option cplex_options 'baropt';</tt>
-->

<p>

Here is some <b><a href=amplhints>more information about working with
AMPL</a></b>.

<h3>The NEOS Server</h3>
AMPL can also be run
<A HREF=http://www.neos-server.org/neos/>remotely
on the NEOS server</a>.
You submit your model and data files and it will give you the solution.

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<ul>

and
<a href=http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/>Bob Vanderbei</a>.)

<li>
An excellent collection of
<a href=http://www.orfe.princeton.edu/~rvdb/ampl/nlmodels/><b>nonlinear</b>
programming models</a>.
A good place to start may be the block QP models in the <i>Cute set</i>,
for example
<a href=http://www.orfe.princeton.edu/~rvdb/ampl/nlmodels/cute/blockqp1.mod>blockqp1.mod</a>.
<li>My page of
<a href=http://eaton.math.rpi.edu/faculty/Mitchell/generators/qcqp.html>generators
for nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs</a>
contains more involved examples, with run files that solve multiple
problems, that use the output from one problem
in the input to another, that use random number generators,
and that use if-then-else statements and loops.
</ul>

<h3>Web resources and hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The CPLEX manual is part of the software distribution.
So when you download and install cplex on your computer,
it creates a documentation folder.
The documentation comes in both html and pdf format.
It should give you some sort of introduction to modeling
as well as to the syntax of CPLEX.
It also includes some tutorials in the gscplex.pdf file.
There is also a folder of examples included in the distribution.
The documentation also includes information about installing CPLEX.
