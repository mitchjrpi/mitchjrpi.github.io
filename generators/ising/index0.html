<H1>  Generating Ising spin glass problems </H1>

The problems are generated on a grid, embedded on a torus,
so every vertex has four neighbours.
There is no external field.
Generators are provided for two different distributions:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF=total0>Edge weights = 1 or -1, total weight = 0</A>.
<LI>
<A HREF=total_any>Edge weights = 1 or -1, total weight = anything</A>.
</UL>


The objective is to minimize the ground state energy of the spin glass.
A paper describing the problem in more detail and giving computational
results is
<A HREF=../../papers/compMar99.html>
"Computational experience with
an interior point cutting plane algorithm."</A>
The slides from my
<A HREF=../../talks/seattle_ising.ps>talk</A>
on this problem at the Seattle INFORMS conference are available as
a postscript file.
