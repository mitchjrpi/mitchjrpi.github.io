You can find here pointers to FORTRAN files that can be used
to generate random degenerate linear ordering problems.
In particular, these routines can be used to generate the
thirty problems described in the paper
<A HREF="http://www.math.rpi.edu/~mitchj/papers/combined.html">"Solving
linear ordering problems
with a combined interior point/simplex cutting plane algorithm"</A>:

You need to download two files to generate the problems:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http:linordgen.f">linordgen.f</A>:
This file will take a seed file and generate a linear ordering problem.
<LI><A HREF="http:geninput.f">geninput.f</A>:
This file will create the thirty seed files used in the paper.
</UL>

The following are also available:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http:problems.tar.gz">problems.tar.gz</A> (1.1M):
This contains the thirty instances in a single file.
You will need to <TT>gunzip</TT> the file, and then use <TT>tar</TT> to extract
the instances. The tar process will set up a directory <TT>problems</TT>
containing the instances.
Note: this file is large, so you should probably only download it if
you are unable to get the problem generator to work.
<LI><A HREF="http:gen_probs">gen_probs</A>:
This is a 60 line command file that will take the inputs
created by geninput.f and use linordgen.f to turn them
into the problem instances.
This replaces the mechanical steps of copying the seed files to fort.15
and then creating the actual instances.
Take the following steps:
<OL>
<LI>Compile geninput.f to give an executable <TT>geninput</TT>,
place it in a subdirectory <TT>seeds</TT>, and run it.
<LI>Compile linordgen.f to give an executable <TT>linordgen</TT>,
in the main directory.
<LI>Create another subdirectory called <TT>problems</TT>.
<LI>Run <TT>gen_probs</TT>.
</OL>
<li>
The <a href=values>optimal values</a> of the problems.
</UL>

<H3> The linear ordering problem  </H3>

In the linear ordering problem, we are given MATSIZE objects, and we
have pairwise comparisons between the objects. We want to choose the
best ordering for the objects. MAT(I,J) gives the benefit of placing
I before J in the ordering. Thus, we want to choose the ordering that
solves:
<PRE>
  max  sum MAT(I,J): I is before J in the ordering
</PRE>

A collection of <B>real-world</B> instances of the linear ordering
problem is available from
<A HREF="http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/LOLIB/">
LOLIB</A>.

<H3> The generated instances  </H3>

The files generate random DEGENERATE linear ordering problems.
The coefficients mat_ij are uniformly distributed between 0 and 99
for i < j,and uniformly distributed between 0 and (100*RATIO)-1
for i > j.  They are INTEGRAL.
Further, PROPZERO of the coefficients are zero.
<P>
The program linordgen.f reads in four parameters from the file fort.15:
<UL>
<LI><B>MATSIZE</B>:   The number of sectors in the instance. Can be no larger
than 250.
<LI><B>ISEED</B>:     A random seed.
<LI><B>RATIO</B> and <B>PROPZERO</B>:  See above.
</UL>
MATSIZE and ISEED are integers, the other two numbers can be anything
between 0 and 1. The format of file  fort.15  is
MATSIZE, ISEED, RATIO, PROPZERO
<P>
The generator creates a permutation before actually generating the
instances, so that the trivial ordering is not necessarily a good
guess.
<P>
The FORTRAN program geninput.f generates 30 input files in the required
fort.15 format. These correspond to the instances described in the paper
<A HREF="http://www.math.rpi.edu/~mitchj/papers/combined.html">"Solving
linear ordering problems
with a combined interior point/simplex cutting plane algorithm"</A>.
These seed files are also contained in the subdirectory
<A HREF=seeds>seeds</A>.
The <A HREF=values>optimal values</A> for these problems and
some others are available.
<P>
These input files can then be copied to  fort.15  and then linordgen.f
can be used to generate the matrices. Note that linordgen.f generates
several lines of additional output before generating the entries MAT(I,J).
The entries MAT(I,J) are output as
<PRE>
MAT(1,1)
MAT(1,2)
...
MAT(1,MATSIZE)
MAT(2,1)
MAT(2,2)
...
...
MAT(MATSIZE,1)
MAT(MATSIZE,2)
...
MAT(MATSIZE,MATSIZE)
</PRE>
The file <A HREF="r100a2prob">r100a2prob</A>
contains the output generated by linordgen.f from input
<A HREF="seeds/r100a2">seeds/r100a2</A>.
The first 14 lines contain information about the instance, and the last
10000 lines contain the entries in MAT(.,.)
<P>
Another version of geninput.f that generates a larger number of test
input files is also available:
<A HREF="seeds/geninput0.f">geninput0.f</A>.
The output from this program is in the directory
<A HREF="seeds/lots">seeds/lots</A>.
