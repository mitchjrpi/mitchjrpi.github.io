<H1>  Generating clustering problems </H1>


These problems are generated using the fortran program
<A HREF=initpGP.f>initpGP.f</A>.
This program calls
<A HREF=random.f>random.f</A> as a subroutine.
You can compile them using
<CENTER>
<TT>
f77 initpGP.f random.f -o initpGP
</TT>
</CENTER>
for example.
If you are using SunOS 5.6 (Solaris), you can download the
<A HREF=initpGP>executable</A> directly.

<P>

A sample input file is contained in
<A HREF=fort.17>fort.17</A>;
this produces the output contained in
<A HREF=in40a>in40a</A>.
The output produced by my cutting plane code for this problem
is contained in <A HREF=out40a>out40a</A>.
In general, an input file must be placed in <tt>fort.17</tt>,
and the generated problem will be sent to the standard output.

<P>

The code generates some <I>observations</I>, each with various
<I>characteristics</I>.
The input file <tt>fort.17</tt> contains these two parameters
and also a parameter for a random seed.
The first three rows of output returns the value of these three
parameters.
The remaining rows contain the observations and their characteristics.
Each characteristic can take the value 0, 1, or 2.
It is desired to identify observations that are similar to one another.

<P>
The method we use to formulate this problem as an integer programming problem
is due to Grotschel and Wakabayashi:
<PRE>
    AUTHOR  =  {M. Gr{\"{o}}tschel and Y. Wakabayashi},
    TITLE   =  {A cutting plane algorithm for a clustering problem},
    JOURNAL =  {Mathematical Programming},
    YEAR    =  1989,
    VOLUME  =  45,
    PAGES   =  {59--96}
</PRE>

The observations can be regarded as vertices of a graph.
The length of the edge connecting two graphs is given by
<CENTER>
(Number of observations in which they disagree)
- (Number of observations in which they agree)
</CENTER>
Thus, in the file <A HREF=out40a>out40a</A>,
the distance between observations 1 and 2 is (4-8)=-4.

<P>

We then wish to choose a subset of the edges such that:
<OL>
<LI> The cost of the chosen edges is as small as possible.
<LI> The chosen edges correspond to the edges of cliques,
that is, if edges <TT>(i,j)</TT> and <TT>(j,k)</TT> are chosen
then edge <TT>(i,k)</TT> must also be chosen.
</OL>

The objective is to choose a cut that minimizes the sum of the
weights of the edges appearing in the cut.
Every edge has cost +1 or -1, evenly distributed.

<P>


Seeds and optimal values for selected problems are available:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF=probs12>Problems with 12 characteristics</A>.
<LI><A HREF=probs15>Problems with 15 characteristics</A>.
</UL>

<P>
A paper describing the problem in more detail and giving computational
results is

an interior point cutting plane algorithm."</A>
