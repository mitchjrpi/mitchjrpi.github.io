{\bf\large\bf Abstract:}
\end{center}

The multi-stage stochastic optimization problem has been proposed as a major
advance in the tools available to address uncertainty in finance.  We
explore the merits of this claim, and use a practical problem pulled from
the corporate bond investing world to illustrate the issues raised in our
exploration.  Specifically, the problem we address is: ``Defining Sector
Allocation Limits for Corporate Bond Investing''.
