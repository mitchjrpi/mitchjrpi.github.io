<ul>
<li>
<h4>Part (a)</h4>

Probability that all 42 passengers show up is 
<br>
.9^42 = .01197251518256201978
<p>
Probability that exactly 41 passengers show up is 
<br>
(.9^41)*.1*42 = .05587173751862275860
<p>
Required probability is the sum of these two numbers:
<br>
.06784425270118477838

<p>

<li>
<h4>Part (b)</h4>

<b>53 passengers is OK:</b>
<br>
Probability that all 53 passengers show up is 
<br>
(.9^53) = .00375710212613636260
<br>
Probability that exactly 52 passengers show up is 
<br>
(.9^52)*.1*53 = .02212515696502524601
<br>
Probability that exactly 51 passengers show up is 
<br>
(.9^51)*.01*53*26 = .06391712012118403178
<p>
Adding these numbers, we get
<br>
.00375710212613636260+.02212515696502524601+.06391712012118403178
<br>
  =  .08979937921234564039
<p>
So there is a 91% probability of seating all passengers who arrive.
<p>
<b>54 passengers is too many:</b>
<br>
Probability of exactly one bumped passenger is
<br>
(.9^51)*.001*54*53*52/6 = .11505081621813123240
<br>
which is already too large.
</ul>
