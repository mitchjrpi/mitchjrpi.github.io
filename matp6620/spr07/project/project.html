<P>
The project will involve modeling and computational testing.
You will write up your solution and give a presentation in class.
Your project can be one of the following:

<UL>

<LI>a topic arising in your research
that fits well with the topics covered in the course.
You would work on your own on such a project.

<LI>another project you suggest or I suggest.
You can work in groups of up to three people on such
a project.
All group members should contribute equally to the project. 
Each individual should turn in a one-page description of their 
contribution to the project along with the group report.

</UL>

<P>
Possible topics include:

<UL>

<LI>A cutting plane approach to an integer programming problem.
The cutting plane methods will require the use of AMPL or the CPLEX
callable library
(or C or Fortran).

<LI>A semidefinite
programming relaxation approach to an integer programming problem.
This will require the use of an SDP package
(written in MATLAB).

<LI>Investigation of a
heuristic method or of a relaxation approach for an integer programming problem.

</UL>

<P>
You can suggest the project to me, or I can suggest one.
I would like you to give me an idea for your project by <B>Friday,
February 23</B>. This should be at least a paragraph, perhaps a page,
longer if you have more you want to tell me.
Sources for optimization problems include the following:
