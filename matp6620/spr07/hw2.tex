\begin{enumerate}
   \item  Let $f$ and $g$ be defined as follows.
          \begin{displaymath}
             f(n)  =  \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                                n^3 & \mbox{ if $n$ is prime}  \\
                                n^2 & \mbox{ otherwise}
                            \end{array}  \right.    \;\;\;
             g(n)  =  \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
                                n^3 & \mbox{ if $n$ is even}  \\
                                n^2 & \mbox{ otherwise.}
                            \end{array}  \right.
           \end{displaymath}
           Is either of the following true?
           \begin{enumerate}
              \item  $f(n) = O(g(n))$.
              \item  $g(n) = O(f(n))$.
           \end{enumerate}
   \item
   Assume you have an algorithm A for finding the minimum weight perfect matching
   in a graph with nonnegative edge weights.
   How could you use this algorithm to find the maximum weight matching in
   a graph $G=(V,E)$ with nonnegative edge weights? (Note: the matching isn't required to be perfect.)
%   \item   Consider the graph problem
%           \begin{quote}
%              Does $G$ contain a cycle?
%           \end{quote}
%           Give an algorithm to show that this problem is in $\cal P$.
%           When the answer is {\em Yes}, the circuit itself provides a
%           certificate of feasibility.
%           Is there a similar short proof when the answer is {\em No}?
%   \item   Assume that we have a polynomial time algorithm for {\em computing
%           the length} of the shortest TSP tour, so given any graph $G=(V,E)$
%           with edge lengths $c_e$, this algorithm will tell us the length
%           of the optimal tour, but it will {\em not} tell us the edges
%           that are used in the optimal tour.
%           Prove that we can use this algorithm as a subroutine in a
%           polynomial time algorithm for {\em finding the edges}
%           in the shortest TSP tour.
\item Assume we have a polynomial time algorithm for determining the optimal
value of a binary knapsack problem $\max\{c^Tx: x \in \binary^n, a^Tx \leq b\}$.
This algorithm will not tell us the values of the variables in the optimal solution.
Show that we can use this algorithm as a subroutine in a polynomial time
algorithm for finding the optimal solution to a binary knapsack problem.
%   \item   Assume that we have a polynomial time algorithm for {\em computing
%           the number of nodes} of the largest node packing for any graph $G=(V,E)$.
%           This algorithm will tell us the number of nodes in the optimal packing
%           but it will {\em not} tell us the nodes that are used in the optimal packing.
%           Prove that we can use this algorithm as a subroutine in a
%           polynomial time algorithm for {\em finding the nodes}
%           in the largest node packing.
%   \item   Show that the following problem is ${\cal N}{\cal P}$-complete.
%           \begin{quote}
%             {\em Matching with bonds:}
%             Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, pairwise disjoint subsets $B_i$ for
%             $i=1,\ldots,p$ of $E$, and an integer $K$, does there exist
%             a matching $M$ in $G$ with $|M| \geq K$ and,
%             for $i=1,\ldots,p$, either $B_i\cap M=B_i$ or
%             $B_i\cap M=\emptyset$ (i.e., either all edges in $B_i$ are in the
%             matching or none are)?
%             The subsets $B_i$ are called {\em bonds}.
%           \end{quote}
%   \item   Using the {\em Hamiltonian path} problem, or otherwise,
%           show that the following
%           problem is ${\cal N}{\cal P}$-complete.
%           \begin{quote}
%              Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $L\subseteq V$, is there a
%              spanning tree $T$ of $G$ such that the set of leaves is $L$?
%           \end{quote}
%           (A {\em leaf} of a tree is a vertex of degree 1.
%           The Hamiltonian path problem is: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$,
%           does there
%           exist a path which visits all the vertices of $G$ exactly once?
%           You may assume that this problem is
%           \begin{math}{\cal N}{\cal P}\end{math}-complete.)
  \item Using the {\em undirected Hamiltonian circuit} problem,
  show that the {\em directed Hamiltonian circuit} problem is NP-Complete.
%   \item   Using the {\em Hamiltonian path} problem, or otherwise,
%           show that the following
%           problem is \NP-complete.
%           \begin{quote}
%              Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ %and a positive integer $d \leq |V|$ with $d \geq 2$,
%              is there a subset $E' \subseteq E$ where $G'=(V,E')$ is connected
%              and every vertex in $G'$ has degree no larger than~3? %$d$?
%           \end{quote}
%           (The Hamiltonian path problem is: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$,
%           does there
%           exist a path which visits all the vertices of $G$ exactly once?
%           You may assume that this problem is
%           \NP-complete.)
%  \item   Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a scalar $k$,
%           the {\sc Vertex Cover} problem is to determine whether there exists a
%           subset $U \subseteq V$
%           of no more than $k$ of the vertices so that every edge in $E$ is
%           incident to at least one vertex in~$U$.
%           Show that {\sc Vertex Cover} is \NP-complete.
%           (Hint: use node packing.)
\item Given sets $M$ of customers and $N$ of locations,
integers $c_{ij}$ for $i \in M$ and $j \in N$ of shipping costs,
integers $f_j$ of facility opening costs,
and a scalar $K$,
the {\em uncapacitated facility location} problem is to find
a set $S \subseteq N$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{i \in M} \min_{j \in S} c_{ij} + \sum_{j \in S} f_j  \leq K.
\end{displaymath}
Show that this problem is \NP-complete.
(Hint: use node packing.)
%   \item   Polynomially reduce 3-SAT (a
%           strongly ${\cal N}{\cal P}$-complete problem) to {\sc 0-1~Knapsack
%           With Lower Bound}, that is,
%           \begin{quote}
%           Given vectors $c$ and $a$ in $\Re^n$ and scalars
%           $b$ and $\delta$, does there exist binary $x$ with
%           $c^Tx \geq \delta$ and $a^Tx \leq b$?
%           \end{quote}
%           (Notice that this is a problem solvable in pseudopolynomial time.)

%           (Hint: We know how to transform a clause into an inequality in
%           binary variables. This can be refined slightly by introducing
%           additional binary variables to give an
%           equivalent {\em equality} in binary variables.
%           Construct a sum $a^Tx=b$ of these equalities, such that
%           the single equality $a^Tx=b$ is satisfied by binary variables if and
%           only if all of the original equalities can be satisfied
%           simultaneously by binary variables.
%           We can then get the equivalent {\sc 0-1 Knapsack} problem
%           by taking $c=a$ and $\delta=b$:
%           Does there exist a binary $x$ satisfying $a^Tx \leq b$ and
%           $a^Tx \geq b$?)
%  \item
%    Consider the optimization problem
%    \begin{displaymath}
%    \begin{array}{lccl}
%    \max & x_{12} \\
%    \mbox{subject to} & x_{11} & = & 2  \\
%    & x_{22} & = & 1  \\
%    & \left[ \begin{array}{ll}x_{11}&x_{12}\\x_{12}&x_{22} \end{array} \right]
%       & \mbox{is} & \mbox{positive semidefinite} \\
%    \end{array}
%    \end{displaymath}
%    Show that the optimal value is irrational.
